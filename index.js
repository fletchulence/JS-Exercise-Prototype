  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.

    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

/* 
  TASK 4 ** i like these - hope we can get feedback on it before we do the sprint challenge
  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:

  1. NEW: here, in making new object with constructor functions, "this" refers to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned 
  2. EXPLICIT : when we use the methods .call() or .apply(), the "this" is EXPLICITLY define bc we are explicity calling them with the new functions aforementioned.
  3. IMPLICIT: the object to the left of the dot is what this is referring to when the function is invoked. Implicit is really looking at mostly methods wherein OBJECTS are tied to their key's via dot notation. This makes "this" easy to define by saying that it is tied to the object to the left of the dot (console.log)
  4. WINDOW: if there is no context or object name for the "this" to cling to, the closest thing it can cling to is the window. Meaning that there is no real object to cling to. Therefore this is considered an error.
